# installation

* relies on Pd vanilla. Ideally above v53 for the list object
* clone or download; https://github.com/algomusic/Live-Coding-Toolkit-for-Pure-Data & add to the path via Pd settings.
* should work out of the box apart from that and includes video's and sounds.

Also check out my guide to installing Pd and GEM from source: https://m-onz.net/installing-pure-data-and-gem if the one in your package manager doesn't include the list object.
